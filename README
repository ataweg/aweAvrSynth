My version of a virtual analog synthesizer, derived from Meeblip synthesizer, with much enhancements and improvements:
The most important are:
 * Much more of the sound parameters can be controlled via MIDI, the expanded MIDI mapping for my keyboard is based on the knobs and sliders of a QX49
 * Modified waveform tables, A and B have separate oscillator wavetable parameters.
 * Re-introducing some of the switches and controls from Meeblip V1.05, this can be controlled via MIDI
 * Master volume control via MIDI. It can also be raised the volume.
 * Ring Modulator for metallic sounds
 * Noise generator now makes more or less white noise - new algorithm
 * VCFENVMOD now ranging from -128 to +127.
 * PWM generation needs only one sawooth table.
 * Patch 1 has a default setting and can not be overwritten.
 * The volume is keep constant, when OSC B is switched on or off.
 * The button "dco fm" and "anti-alias" sacrificed for "ring modulator" and "transpose"
